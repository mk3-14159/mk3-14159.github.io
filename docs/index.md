Before you leave,<br />

Let me leave you with my favourite quote:

> I am wiser than this man, <br />for neither of us appears to know anything great and good;<br /> but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; <br /> whereas I, as I do not know anything, do not fancy I do. <br />In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, <br />because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.<br />
