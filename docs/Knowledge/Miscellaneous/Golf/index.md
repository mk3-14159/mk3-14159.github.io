### Objective 
- Hit the ball into the hole using as few strokes as possible.
- Consists of 18 holes (Some courses have 9)
- Each hole starts from a designated teeing area.
- Courses are varied, some include obstacles like sand bunkers and water hazards.

### Gameplay 
- [Stroke Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play) - Based on total number of strokes.
- [Match Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play) - Based on total number of holes won.

### Swinging 
- Grip 
    - Should be relaxed yet firm.
    - For a right-handed player, the left hand should be on top with the thumb pointing down the shaft (and vice verca).

- Stance 
    - Should be feet shoulder width apart, facing the ball. 
    - Your body in parallel with the target.

- Impact 
    - Body should slightly tilt to the target. 
    - Follow through with the rotation of the upper body. 
    - Power comes from the hips.

### Putting
- Grip 
    - Soft grip.
    - Use the [reverse overlap grip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GMQirA1WmI).

- Stance 
    - Closer than feet shoulder width apart.
    - Eyes should be directly over the ball.
    - Swing in a pendulum motion.

- Impact 
    - Smooth tempo prioritizing accuracy.
    - Follow through in equal length was the backstroke

### Chipping 
- Grip
    - Lower the grip closer to the shaft.
    - Break using wrists slightly when taking the club back after a chip. 

- Stance
    - Feet closer together than a full swing.
    - Weight predominantly on front foot.

- Impact
    - Keep wrists firm while hitting the ball.
    - Finish with clubface pointing the target. 

### Mental Game 
Your mental game in golf is equally as important as the physical game.

- Stay present 
    - Focus on the current shot instead of dwelling on past mistakes. Use breathing techniques to calm nerves and reduce stress. 

- Positivity 
    - Maintain a positive attitude to avoid throwing the game. Self talk can be beneficial to encourage yourself through affirmations.

- Visualisation 
    - Before each shot, visualize the ball path and desired outcome. This also helps you develop concentration and focus.

- Practice 
    - I'm guilty of not following through with this, but being patient and practicing regularly could help you get better at golf through [The Compound Effect](https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/the-compound-effect)
