- The asymmetry model leads to an application in warfare whereby one side seemingly “plays by different rules” than the other side due to circumstance. 
- This model is applied by an insurgency with limited resources. 
- Unable to out-muscle their opponents, asymmetric fighters use other tactics, as with terrorism creating fear that's disproportionate to their actual destructive ability.

!!! example "Example of Asymmetric Warfare"
