- Attempting to manipulate an [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) response in place of a valid or compelling argument.
- Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, pride, and more. 
- It's important to note that sometimes a logically coherent argument may inspire emotion or have an emotional aspect, but the problem and fallacy occurs when emotion is used instead of a logical argument, or to obscure the fact that no compelling rational reason exists for one's position. 
- Everyone, bar [sociopaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Sociopathy), is affected by emotion, and so appeals to emotion are a very common and effective argument tactic, but they're ultimately flawed, dishonest, and tend to make one's opponents justifiably emotional.
