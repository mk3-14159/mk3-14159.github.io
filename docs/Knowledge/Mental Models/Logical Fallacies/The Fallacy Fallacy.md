description: logical fallacies, the fallacy fallacy
---
- Presuming that because a claim has been poorly argued, or a fallacy has been made, that the claim itself must be wrong.
- It is entirely possible to make a claim that is false yet argue with logical coherency for that claim, just as it is possible to make a claim that is true and justify it with various fallacies and poor arguments.

!!! Example "Fallacy Fallacy Example"
    Recognising that Amanda had committed a fallacy in arguing that we should eat healthy food because a nutritionist said it was popular, Alyse said we should therefore eat bacon double cheeseburgers every day.
