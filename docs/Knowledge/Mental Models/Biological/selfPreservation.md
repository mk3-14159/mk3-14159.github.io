- Without a strong self-preservation instinct in an organismâ€™s DNA, it would tend to disappear over time, thus eliminating that DNA. 
- While cooperation is another important model, the self-preservation instinct is strong in all organisms and can cause violent, erratic, and/or destructive behavior for those around them.
