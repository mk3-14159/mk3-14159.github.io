- An ecosystem describes any group of organisms coexisting with the natural world. 
- Most ecosystems show diverse forms of life taking on different approaches to survival, with such pressures leading to varying behavior. 
- Social systems can be seen in the same light as the physical ecosystems and many of the same conclusions can be made.
