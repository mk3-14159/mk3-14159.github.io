- One of the marvels of modern [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) has been the bookkeeping system introduced in Genoa in the 14th century. 

- The double-entry system requires that every entry, such as income, also be entered into another corresponding account. 

- Correct double-entry bookkeeping acts as a check on potential accounting errors and allows for accurate records and thus, more accurate behavior by the owner of a firm.
