- Scottish economist, [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith), highlighted the advantages gained in a free-market system by specialization. 

- Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that itâ€™s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. 

- He also cautioned, however, that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.
