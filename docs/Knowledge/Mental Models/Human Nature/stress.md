- Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. 
- Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a [fight-or-flight response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response), relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman)’s “[System 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_system)” type of reasoning. 
- Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto: “In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”
