- Justice runs deep in our veins. 
- In another illustration of our relative sense of well-being, we are careful arbiters of what is fair. 
- Violations of fairness can be considered grounds for [reciprocal action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)), or at least distrust. 
- Yet fairness itself seems to be a moving target. What is seen as fair and just in one time and place may not be in another. 
- Consider that slavery has been seen as perfectly natural and perfectly unnatural in alternating phases of human existence.
