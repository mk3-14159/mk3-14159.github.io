- Fundamentally, the modern world operates on trust. 
- Familial trust is generally a given (otherwise weâ€™d have a hell of a time surviving)
- We also choose to trust chefs, clerks, drivers, factory workers, executives, and many others [professions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession). 
- A trusting system is one that tends to work most efficiently; the rewards of trust are extremely high.
