- As psychologists have frequently and famously demonstrated, humans are subject to a [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias) towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible. 
- This trait is necessary for social cohesion: people who often change their conclusions and habits are often distrusted. 
- Our bias towards staying consistent can become, as one wag put it, a “[hobgoblin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobgoblin) of foolish minds” – when it is combined with the [first-conclusion bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias), we end up landing on poor answers and standing pat in the face of great evidence.
