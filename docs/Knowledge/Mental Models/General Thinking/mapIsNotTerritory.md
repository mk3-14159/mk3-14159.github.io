- The map of reality is not reality itself. 
- If any map were to represent its actual territory with perfect fidelity, it would be the size of the territory itself. 
- No need for a map! This model tells us that there will always be an imperfect relationship between reality and the models we use to represent and understand it. 
- This imperfection is a necessity in order to simplify. It is all we can do to accept this and act accordingly.
