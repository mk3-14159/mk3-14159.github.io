- The basic insight of biology suggests that all creatures respond to incentives to keep themselves alive.
- Constant incentives will tend to cause a biological entity to have constant behavior. 
- Humans are are particularly great examples of the incentive-driven nature of biology but humans are complicated in that their incentives can be hidden or intangible. 
- The rule of life is to repeat what works and has been rewarded.
