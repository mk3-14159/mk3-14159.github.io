- We like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all, an instinct which led us out of the [savanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna) and led us to learn a great deal about the world around us, using that information to create the world in our collective minds. 
- The curiosity instinct leads to unique human behavior and forms of organization like the scientific enterprise. Even before there were direct incentives to innovate, humans innovated out of curiosity.
