- Attacking your opponent's character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.
- Ad hominem attacks can take the form of overtly attacking somebody, or more subtly casting doubt on their character or personal attributes as a way to discredit their argument. 
- The result of an ad hom attack can be to undermine someone's case without actually having to engage with it.
