- Presuming that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.
- Many people confuse [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) (things happening together or in sequence) for [causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causation_(law)) (that one thing actually causes the other to happen). Sometimes correlation is coincidental, or it may be attributable to a common cause.
