- Arguing that because something is '[natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature)' it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, good or ideal.
- Many 'natural' things are also considered 'good', and this can [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias) our thinking; but naturalness itself doesn't make something good or bad. 
- For instance murder could be seen as very natural, but that doesn't mean it's good or justifiable.
