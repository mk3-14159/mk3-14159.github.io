- Mr. Market was introduced by the investor [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham) in his seminal book [The Intelligent Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Investor) to represent the vicissitudes of the [financial markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market). 
- Graham explains, the markets are a bit like a moody neighbor, sometimes waking up happy and sometimes waking up sad â€“ your job as an investor is to take advantage of him in his bad moods and sell to him in his good moods. 
- This attitude is contrasted to an [efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) in which Mr. Market always wakes up in the middle of the bed, never feeling overly strong in either direction.
