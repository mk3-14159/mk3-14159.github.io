- All organisms feel pleasure and pain from simple chemical processes in their bodies which respond predictably to the outside world. 
- Reward-seeking is an effective survival-promoting technique on average. 
- The same pleasure receptors can be co-opted to cause destructive behavior, as with drug abuse.

!!! example "Example of Reward Seeking"
