!!! quote "MK Chong"
    My study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. Biological systems comprise a wide range of fields such as genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology, allowing for a detailed understanding of the natural world and the complex interactions within it. My goal for this section is to understand the rules governing life and the mechanisms through which living organisms interact with each other and their environments.
