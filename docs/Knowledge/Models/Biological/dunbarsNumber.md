- The primatologist [Robin Dunbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar) observed through study that the number of individuals a primate can get to know and trust closely is related to the size of its [neocortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex). 
- Extrapolating from his study of primates, Dunbar theorized that the Dunbar number for a human being is somewhere in the 100â€“250 range, which is supported by certain studies of human behavior and social networks.

!!! example "Example of Dunbar's Number"
    Dunbar's number can be exemplified in the typical size of a [military company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_(military_unit)), which usually consists of about 150 soldiers, aligning with the theory's limit on stable social relationships.
