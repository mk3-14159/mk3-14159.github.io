# My first blog
I'm excited to announce the start of my very own blog. My aim is to adopt a holistic approach to self-improvement through documentation and notes. This endeavour will undoubtedly push me beyond my comfort zone, and while I don't anticipate a large readership, if you're reading this, I want to thank you for being here.

### Why am I doing this?

| Learning | I will document my journey and progress in life and professional career by sharing my ideas, challenges and breakthroughs as I learn new techically challenging topics |
| Self Reflection | I will share my personal insights, ideas and experiences in the realm of technology and value creation. I also hope to highlight and internalize the lessons I've learned and identify opportunities for personal growth |
| Therapy | I want help myself by cultivating a positive mindset, managing stress, finding motivation and overcoming obstacles. Writing it out helps me manifest my desires through action |
